As teenagers and young adults we loved browser games. Especially those using a Sci-Fi space environment like OGame, XWars and others.

This repository is just a playground aiming at two things:
- becoming more and more familiar with Unity3D
- re-living those amazing memories of the 1990s and 2000s, creating our own little homage to those times back then
